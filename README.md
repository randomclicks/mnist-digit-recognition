# MNIST Digit Recognition Project

A comprehensive implementation of a handwritten digit recognition system using the MNIST dataset and deep learning.

## Overview

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset. The implementation includes:

- A neural network model training pipeline
- Testing tools for evaluating on new images
- Interactive applications for real-time recognition
- Visualization tools for understanding the model's behavior
